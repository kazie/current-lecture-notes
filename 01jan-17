Generic structure of parallel computers
	A perallel computer is a collection of concurrently executing, communicating processing elements
	Potential for largeperformance boost:
		  1000 processors run 1000 times faster than one processor
	Or, tackle a problem 1000 time the size, accuracy, ...
	A parallel computer increases memory capacity &c

	A collection of P processor--memory paries that communicates with eachother

	When there is a global memory we have a shared memory architecture, also known as a multiprocessor
	Where there is no global memory we have a "share nothing" architecture (also known as a distributed
	memory architecture), also known as a multicomputer.
